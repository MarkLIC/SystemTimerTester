This utility is designed to help determine if a PC is susceptible to "timer
drift" across multiple cores.  We had at least one customer whose PC had this
issue, and as a result when he was using an application that used the
Performance Counter under Windows XP, his timing values were sometimes out of
order.

To build, simply open MultiCoreHighPerformanceTimer.sln and build (under VS2010).

This project depends on the .NET 4 Client Profile.
